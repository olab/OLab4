# OLab4
==============
OLab4 is an open-source (GNU-GPL3 license) platform for creating and playing virtual scenarios, and conducting educational research. 

It is based on OpenLabyrinth. For more information about OpenLabyrinth generally, see http://openlabyrinth.ca

For specific information about OLab4, consult http://olab.ca

You do not need any software to play a case. Any modern web browser will work. If you want to try authoring your own cases,
Olab4 will be installable on a basic web server running Apache, MySQL, and PHP (eg a LAMP, WAMP setup etc.) 

If you are comfortable using Git to clone, pull etc, this will work fine. 

If you want to see some of the latest development features, send us a note via info AT openlabyrinth DOT ca and we can set 
you up with a test account
