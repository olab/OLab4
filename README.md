# Welcome to Entrada ME

Entrada is an open source web-based Integrated Teaching and Learning System created to allow teachers, learners and
curriculum managers a simple way of accessing, interacting, and managing curriculum within an educational environment.

Entrada is ideally suited for the health sciences because of its tightly integrated curriculum management and clinical
scheduling support; however, it can easily be modified and adapted to almost any professional program. The Entrada
Project is built upon the philosophies of open access and collaboration, and we welcome new interest in the project.
