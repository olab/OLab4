# Welcome to OLab4

OLab4 is an open source web-based educational research platform that supports the creation and publication of virtual scenarios. Much of its original structure is based on OpenLabyrinth v3, a platform that was originally designed to support virtual patients but evolved into so much more. 

For more information please visit our website: http://olab.ca 

In its early phases, OLab4 is based on the Entrada framework, an open source web-based Integrated Teaching and Learning System created to allow teachers, learners and
curriculum managers a simple way of accessing, interacting, and managing curriculum within an educational environment. (http://www.entrada-project.org)

However, OLab4 remains a standalone project. You do not have to adopt Entrada, or Elentra (its subsequent iteration), in order to use or install OLab4. There are no licensing commitments to those groups.
