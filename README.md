# OLab4
==============
OLab4 is an open-source (GNU-GPL3 license) educational research platform with a focus on creating and playing virtual scenarios, with strong underlying activity metrics. Track what your learners really do, not what their teachers think they do.  

For more information about OLab generally, see http://openlabyrinth.ca initially. Eventually, more detailed info will be available on http://olab.ca 

You do not need any software to play a case. Any modern web browser will work. 

If you want to try authoring your own cases, OLab4 can be installed on a basic web server running Apache, MySQL, and PHP (eg a LAMP, WAMP setup etc.) We will also be offering trial accounts on our demo server where you can test out a few ideas. 

Watch this space.
