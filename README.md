# Welcome to OLab4

OLab4 is an open source web-based education research platform, created to support a variety of approaches to data-informed educational research projects and programs. 

The base data schemas for OLab4 are derived from OpenLabyrinth v3 (http://openlabyrinth.ca/), which grew from virtual patients to being able to support a wide variety of educational scenarios and other research activities. The system architecture of OLab4 has moved from an MVC model to being more ORM-based, and uses the Entrada curriculum management platform for some of its core functionality. 

OLab4 uses Docker containers as a mechanism to simplify the installation and maintenance of the server and services. 

Entrada is an open source web-based Integrated Teaching and Learning System created to allow teachers, learners and
curriculum managers a simple way of accessing, interacting, and managing curriculum within an educational environment.

Entrada is ideally suited for the health sciences because of its tightly integrated curriculum management and clinical
scheduling support; however, it can easily be modified and adapted to almost any professional program. The Entrada
Project is built upon the philosophies of open access and collaboration, and we welcome new interest in the project.
