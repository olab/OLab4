Evaluation of your rotation provides valuable feedback about your clinical placement, to ensure that we continue to provide a quality educational experience and identify opportunities for improvement. All rotation evaluations are confidential. Only pooled evaluation data for the entire class is released upon class graduation in the spring. The clerkship course directors and regional site leads appreciate receiving evaluations of the rotations, to facilitate feedback and optimize clerkship education.

Timely completion of evaluations is a component of professionalism.
