Dear %LEARNER_NAME%, 

We hope your stay in your Regional Education accommodation was satisfactory.  As your stay is nearing an end, we would like to take this opportunity to send you a reminder of Learner Responsibilities, to ensure that the accommodations are ready for the next occupant. 

As posted under "Learner Responsibilities" on the Regional Education website and in your assigned accommodation, it is your responsibility to:

- Wash all linens you have used during your stay

- Clean the washroom

- Clean the kitchen (including the fridge-dispose of any unused food)

- Take out garbage and recycling to designated areas

The next occupant will expect to find the apartment neat and tidy.   A representative from the Regional Education office will be entering the accommodation within the last few days of your rotation to ascertain whether supplies or repairs are needed.  You will receive 24-hrs notice prior to this visit.
